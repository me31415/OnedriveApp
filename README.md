![](images/demo.gif)

In this demonstration, it creates a folder with the name of "SampleFolder" on OneDrive, and then a spreadsheet file is uploaded to the created folder. The spreadsheet is converted to excel file and uploaded. The scripts which was used here is as follows.

```javascript
function createFolder() {
  OnedriveApp.init(PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()).creatFolder(
    "SampleFolder"
  );
}

function uploadFile() {
  var id = DriveApp.getFilesByName("samplespreadsheet").next().getId();
  OnedriveApp.init(PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()).uploadFile(
    id,
    "/SampleFolder/"
  );
}
```

## How to install

- Open Script Editor. And please operate follows by click.
- -> Resource
- -> Library
- -> Input Script ID to text box. Script ID is **`1wfoCE1mCQpGQZZ9CrWFY_NvA9iRxkNbxN_qTGSBkRkmn8I2eguLVwfZs`**.
- -> Add library
- -> Please select latest version
- -> Developer mode ON (If you don't want to use latest version, please select others.)
- -> Identifier is "**`OnedriveApp`**". This is set under the default.

[If you want to read about Libraries, please check this.](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guide_libraries).

- The method of `downloadFile()` and `uploadFile()` use Drive API v3. But, don't worry. Recently, I confirmed that users can use Drive API by only [the authorization for Google Services](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/authorization). Users are not necessary to enable Drive API on Google API console. By the authorization for Google Services, Drive API is enabled automatically.

# Usage

Also, you can see "[Known issues with Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues)".

<a name="drive"></a>

## Drive of Microsoft Graph API

These methods manage OneDrive.

<a name="retrievefilelist"></a>

### 1. Retrieve file list on OneDrive

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.getFilelist("### folder name ###");
```

Filenames and file IDs are returned.

If `"### folder name ###"` is not inputted (`var res = odapp.getFilelist()`), files and folders on the root directory are retrieved.

<a name="deletefilesandfolders"></a>

### 2. Delete files and folders on OneDrive.

When a file is deleted,

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.deleteItemByName("### filename ###");
```

When a folder is deleted,

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.deleteItemByName("/### folder name ###/");
```

In the case of folder, please enclose it in `/`.

If you want to delete files and folders using item ID, please use as follows.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.deleteItemById("### item ID ###");
```

#### Note :

**If you delete a folder, the files in the folder are also deleted. Please be careful about this.**

<a name="createfolder"></a>

### 3. Create folder on OneDrive.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.creatFolder("### foldername ###", "/### path ###/");
```

Created folder name and ID are returned. If you want to create a folder of `newfolder` in the folder of `/root/sample1/sample2/`, please use as follows. If there is no folder `sample2` on your OneDrive, following script creates `sample2` and `newfolder`, simultaneously.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.creatFolder("newfolder", "/sample1/sample2/");
```

<a name="downloadfiles"></a>

### 4. Download files from OneDrive to Google Drive.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.downloadFile("### file with path ###", convert from Microsoft to Google (true or false), "### Folder ID on Google Drive ###");
```

Downloaded file name and ID on Google Drive are returned. When a file is downloaded from OneDrive to Google Drive, if the file is Microsoft Office Docs, you can select whether the file is converted to Google Docs. If you want to convert, you can use following sample.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.downloadFile(
  "/SampleFolder/sample.xlsx",
  true,
  "### Folder ID on Google Drive ###"
);
```

In this case, Excel file is converted to Google Spreadsheet, and imported to the folder ID. If you don't want to convert, you can use following sample. If the folder ID is not set, the file is created to root directory on your Google Drive.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.downloadFile(
  "/SampleFolder/sample.xlsx",
  false,
  "### Folder ID on Google Drive ###"
);
```

In this case, only an Excel file is downloaded to Google Drive.

If you use following simple script, the file `sample.xlsx` is just created to root directory.

```javascript
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.downloadFile("/SampleFolder/sample.xlsx");
```

#### Note :

**From my previous experiences, I think that the maximum response size using URL Fetch is about 10 MB. And furthermore, there are the limitations for the download size in 1 day ([URL Fetch data received 100MB / day](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas#current_limitations)). So when you use this download method, please be careful the file size.**

<a name="uploadfiles"></a>

### 5. Upload files from Google Drive to OneDrive.

```javascript
var fileid = "### file id ###";
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.uploadFile(fileid, "/### folder name on OneDrive ###/");
```

Uploaded filename and ID on OneDrive are returned. In the case of folder, please enclose it in `/`.

When you want to upload a Spreadsheet on Google Drive to a folder of `SampleFolder`, the Spreadsheet is converted to Excel file and uploaded to OneDrive. As a sample, when it uploads Spreadsheet to `/SampleFolder/` on OneDrive, the script is as follows.

```javascript
var fileid = "### file id ###";
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.uploadFile(fileid, "/SampleFolder/sample.xlsx");
```

At the following script, a file with the file id is uploaded to the root directory on OneDrive.

```javascript
var fileid = "### file id ###";
var prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
var odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
var res = odapp.uploadFile(fileid);
```

#### Note :

**About this upload, in this library, [the resumable upload](https://dev.onedrive.com/items/upload_large_files.htm) is used for uploading files. So you can upload files with large size to OneDrive. But the chunk size is 10 MB, because of [the limitation of URL Fetch POST size on Google](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas#current_limitations). The file with large size is uploaded by separating by 10 MB. There are no limitations for upload size in one day.**

## Utilities

<a name="getaccesstoken"></a>

### 1. Get access token

```javascript
const accessToken = OnedriveApp.init(
  PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()
).getAccessToken();
console.log(accessToken);
```

The access token is simply returned. When this access token is used, you can also test other methods of Microsoft Graph API.

<a name="email"></a>

## Email of Microsoft Graph API

These methods manage Email.

<a name="getemaillist"></a>

### 1. Get Email message list

```javascript
const obj = {
  numberOfEmails: 1,
  select: ["createdDateTime", "sender", "subject", "bodyPreview"],
  orderby: "createdDateTime",
  order: "desc",
  folderId: "###",
};

const prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
const odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
const res = odapp.getEmailList(obj);
console.log(res);
```

This method retrieves email list of your Microsoft account using Microsoft Graph API.

About the properties of `obj`, you can see the following explanation.

- `numberOfEmails`: Number of output email in the list. If the properties of `numberOfEmails` and `folderId` are not used, all email messages are retrieved.
- `select: Properties you want to retrieve for each email of list. When you use `["*"]`, all properties are retrieved. But in this case, the process time is longer. Please be careful this.
- `orderby`: When this is used, the list is ordered by the value of `orderby`.
- `order`: `desc` or `asc`.
- `folderId`: When you use this property, you can retrieve the email list from the specific folder of Email. About the method for retrieving the folder ID, please check "[Forward Email messages](#forwardemails)". When you don't use this property, all emails are retrieved as a list.

Sample script: [This is a sample script for retrieving all emails from own emails of Microsoft and put to the Google Spreadsheet.](https://gist.github.com/tanaikech/45a5511cf2a4a42660b52b3409f7b537)

const prop = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
const odapp = OnedriveApp.init(prop);
const res = odapp.getEmailMessages(ar);
console.log(res);
```

- The argument of `getEmailMessages(ar)` is an array including the message IDs. You can retrieve the message IDs with [the method of `getEmailList`](#getemaillist).

<a name="sendemails"></a>

### 3. Send Email messages

This method sends email messages using Microsoft Graph API with your Microsoft account. As an important point of this method, in this method, the multiple emails can be sent using the batch request.
